## 🧠 Why This Exists

YouTube is dope for learning—but let’s be real, it’s a slippery slope from “How to Learn JavaScript” to “Cats Meowing to Techno Remix in Shorts.”  
This extension helps you stay in **deep work mode**, especially if you’re grinding through code, tutorials, or just trying to level up.

## ✨ How It Works

- Injects a script into YouTube when you visit the site
- Removes **Shorts sections** from the homepage
- Scans video titles and hides anything not related to coding (based on keywords like `code`, `javascript`, `python`, etc.)
- Monitors dynamic page updates to keep you locked in
